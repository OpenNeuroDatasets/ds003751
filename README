Overview
--------
This is the "Emotion" dataset. It was collected as part of a small
scale replication project targeting the following reference:

Matthias Schultze-Kraft et al.
"Predicting Motor Intentions with Closed-Loop Brain-Computer Interfaces".
In: Springer Briefs in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
Springer International Publishing, 2017, pp. 79–90.

In brief, it contains EEG data for 7 subjects raising either their left or right hand,
thus giving rise to a lateralized readiness potential as measured with the EEG.
For details, see the `Details about the experiment` section.

Format
------
The dataset is formatted according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure. See the
`dataset_description.json` file for the specific version used.

Generally, you can find data in the .tsv files and descriptions in the
accompanying .json files.

An important BIDS definition to consider is the "Inheritance Principle", which
is described in the BIDS specification under the following link:

The section states that:

> Any metadata file (​.json​​,​.tsv​, etc.) may be defined at any directory
level. The values from the top level are inherited by all lower levels unless
they are overridden by a file at the lower level.


Details about the experiment
----------------------------
For a detailed description of the task, see Schultze-Kraft et al. (2017)
and the supplied `task-emotion_eeg.json` file.

Short description about the experiment should be here.

The original data was recorded in `.mff` format using NetStation. It is stored in the `/sourcedata`
directory. To comply with the BIDS format, the .set format was converted to
eeglab format.
